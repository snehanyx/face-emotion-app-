## 🎭 How Emotion Simulation Works
Unlike real emotion detection which uses deep learning, this app simulates emotion labels using:

OpenCV to detect face bounding boxes

Python’s random module to assign emotions like:

😄 Happy

😢 Sad

😠 Angry

😐 Neutral

😲 Surprise

😕 Confused

This makes it super lightweight and avoids all AI/ML model dependencies — great for quick demos and UI showcases.

##💡 Possible Upgrades
🔌 Plug in a trained model (.h5 or FER) for real emotion detection

🎨 Add emotion-based emoji overlays

📱 Make it mobile-responsive

🧠 Integrate MediaPipe or DeepFace
